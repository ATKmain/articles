# ROI of Investing in Australian Property vs Bitcoin

## Investing in Australian Property

Investing in property has long been considered a solid and lucrative strategy for growing wealth, particularly in markets like Australia. Property investments can deliver high returns on investment (ROI) due to consistent property appreciation, rental income, and the leveraging effect of loans. In this article, we will explore why property investment can yield such high returns, using average numbers to provide a comprehensive overview of potential outcomes over 10, 20, and 30 years. We will base our example on an initial investment of $100,000, leveraging a loan to buy property, and accounting for common costs such as management fees and selling commissions.

### Average Numbers in Australia

1. **Property Appreciation**: Historically, Australian property prices have appreciated at an average annual rate of 6-7%.
2. **Rental Yield**: Rental yields in Australia typically range from 3-5%, with an average around 4%.
3. **Loan Interest Rates**: The average home loan interest rate hovers around 3-4%.
4. **Management Fees**: Property management fees are usually around 10% of rental income.
5. **Selling Commissions**: Real estate agent commission fees are approximately 2.5% of the selling price.

### Investment Example: Initial $100,000

Assume you invest $100,000 as a down payment on a $1,000,000 property (90% loan), and sell the property at the end of each period (10, 20, and 30 years).

#### Key Assumptions
- **Property Value**: $1,000,000
- **Down Payment (Equity)**: $100,000
- **Loan Amount**: $900,000 (90% LVR)
- **Interest Rate**: 4%
- **Property Appreciation**: 7% per annum
- **Rental Yield**: 4% per annum
- **Management Fees**: 10% of rental income
- **Selling Commission**: 2.5% of property value

### Calculations Over Different Periods

#### 10 Years

**Future Property Value**:
\[ \text{Future Value} = 1,000,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{10} = 1,967,151 \]

**Remaining Loan Balance (after 10 years)**:
Using an amortization calculator:
\[ \text{Remaining Balance} \approx 731,000 \]

**Total Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Rental Income} = 1,000,000 \times 0.04 = 40,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Rental Income over 10 years} = 40,000 \times 10 = 400,000 \]

**Net Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Management Fee} = 40,000 \times 0.10 = 4,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Rental Income} = 40,000 - 4,000 = 36,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Net Rental Income over 10 years} = 36,000 \times 10 = 360,000 \]

**Total Mortgage Payments**:
\[ \text{Annual Mortgage Payment} = 12 \times 4,297.45 = 51,569.40 \]
\[ \text{Total Mortgage Payments over 10 years} = 51,569.40 \times 10 = 515,694 \]

**Total Interest Paid**:
Using an amortization calculator, the total interest paid over 10 years is approximately $314,217.

### Summary of Potential ROI

| Investment Period | Total Profit   | Total ROI | Average Annual ROI |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 10 Years          | ~$1,232,755    | 1233%     | ~31.6%            |
| 20 Years          | ~$3,478,378    | 3478%     | ~20.6%            |
| 30 Years          | ~$7,690,976    | 7691%     | ~17.0%            |

### Why Does ROI Decrease?

The Average Annual ROI decreases when the length of the investment increases due to the nature of compound growth and the amortization of loans. Here's a detailed explanation of why this happens:

#### Compound Growth and Diminishing Returns

1. **Initial High Returns**: In the early years of property investment, the returns can appear very high because the initial investment (down payment) is relatively small compared to the leveraged amount (total property value). The property value increases based on the total value, not just the down payment, leading to high initial ROI.

2. **Compounding Effect**: Over time, while the absolute returns grow due to the compounding effect of appreciation, the relative percentage growth (annual ROI) tends to stabilize or decrease. This is because the base value (initial investment) grows larger, and additional gains represent a smaller percentage of this larger base.

#### Loan Amortization

1. **Interest Payments**: In the initial years of a mortgage, a significant portion of the monthly payments goes towards paying interest rather than principal. This means that the net gains (after interest payments) are lower in the beginning, but as time goes on, more of the payment goes towards the principal, reducing the interest burden.

2. **Decreasing Interest Payments**: Over a longer period, the interest component decreases, and the principal repayment increases. However, the total return calculation includes all payments made, which can lower the annualized ROI as the investment period extends.

#### Cost Impact

1. **Management Fees and Selling Commissions**: These costs impact the overall profit but are relatively fixed percentages. As the investment duration increases, the impact of these costs is spread over a longer period, slightly stabilizing the ROI but also contributing to a lower annualized return when calculated over an extended time frame.

## Bitcoin Investment

Let's assume we invest $100,000 in Bitcoin at today's price of $60,000 per Bitcoin ankd Bitcoin prive will be one million dollers in 7 to 11 years (now is 2024 and in year 2031 to 2035 will be $1MM). We'll compare this to a property investment over 10, 20, and 30 years.

### Bitcoin Investment Assumptions
- **Initial Investment**: $100,000
- **Current Bitcoin Price**: $60,000
- **Future Bitcoin Value**: $1,000,000 in 7 to 11 years

### Scenario 1: Future Value $1mil in 7 Years

**Total Bitcoins Purchased**:
\[ \text{Total Bitcoins} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Current Bitcoin Price}} \]
\[ \text{Total Bitcoins} = \frac{100,000}{60,000} \approx 1.67 \]

**Future Value**:
\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Total Bitcoins} \times \text{Future Bitcoin Price} \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 1.67 \times 1,000,000 \approx 1,670,000 \]

**Total ROI Calculation**:
\[ \text{Total ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{Future Value} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Total ROI} = \left( \frac{1,670,000 - 100,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100 = 1570\% \]

**Average Annual ROI Calculation (CAGR)**:
\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Future Value}}{\text{Present Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]
\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{1,670,000}{100,000} \right)^{\frac{1}{7}} - 1 \]
\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( 16.7 \right)^{\frac{1}{7}} - 1 \approx 0.611 \]
\[ \text{Average Annual ROI} \approx 61.1\% \]

### Scenario 2: Future Value $1mil in 11 Years

**Future Value**:
\[ \text{Future Value} = 1.67 \times 1,000,000 \approx 1,670,000 \]

**Total ROI Calculation**:
\[ \text{Total ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{Future Value} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Total ROI} = \left( \frac{1,670,000 - 100,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100 = 1570\% \]

**Average Annual ROI Calculation (CAGR)**:
\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Future Value}}{\text{Present Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]
\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{1,670,000}{100,000} \right)^{\frac{1}{11}} - 1 \]
\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( 16.7 \right)^{\frac{1}{11}} - 1 \approx 0.365 \]
\[ \text{Average Annual ROI} \approx 36.5\% \]

| Investment Period | Total Profit   | Total ROI | Average Annual ROI |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 7 Years           | ~$1,570,000    | 1570%     | ~61.1%             |
| 11 Years          | ~$1,570,000    | 1570%     | ~36.5%             |

### Simple Comparison of Property Investment and Bitcoin Investment

Here’s a side-by-side comparison of investing $100,000 in property and Bitcoin, considering the respective returns and risks over different time periods.

When comparing property investment and Bitcoin investment, several key points emerge:

1. **Stability and Risk**: 
   - **Property Investments**: Generally more stable and less volatile, with steady appreciation over time.
   - **Bitcoin Investments**: Potentially higher returns but come with significant risk due to price volatility.

2. **Returns**: 
   - **Short-Term Gains**: Bitcoin has the potential to deliver much higher returns over shorter periods especially if buy in dips and sell at Highs (e.g., 61.1% annual ROI over 7 years).
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Property investment provides substantial long-term growth with lower risk. For instance, a 30-year property investment can yield a 17.0% average annual ROI.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **High Risk/High Reward**: Bitcoin could be a compelling option for those seeking potentially high short-term gains and willing to accept higher risk.
   - **Stable Long-Term Growth**: Property investment remains a strong choice for investors looking for long-term, stable growth.

## Buying in Dips and Selling at Highs: A Strategy Comparison

When investing, one popular strategy is to buy assets when their prices dip (are lower than average) and sell them when prices peak (are higher than average). This approach can be applied to both property and Bitcoin investments, but the dynamics of each market are different. Let’s compare how this strategy might work for property and Bitcoin.

### Property Investment Strategy

**Property Market Dynamics:**
- The property market generally follows a slower, more predictable cycle compared to Bitcoin. Property prices are influenced by factors such as economic growth, interest rates, and demographic trends.
- Property values tend to appreciate steadily over time, with occasional market corrections.

**Buy in Dips:**
- **Market Corrections**: Purchase property during economic downturns or market corrections when prices are lower.
- **Location**: Focus on areas with high growth potential but temporarily depressed prices.

**Sell at Highs:**
- **Boom Periods**: Sell property during economic booms or housing market peaks when demand and prices are high.

**Example Scenario:**
1. **Initial Investment**: $100,000 in a $1,000,000 property.
2. **Buy During Dip**: Buy during a market correction at a 10% discount, getting the property for $900,000.
3. **Sell During High**: Sell during a boom period where prices increase by 20%, selling the property for $1,080,000.
4. **Total ROI Calculation**:
   - **Profit from Sale**: $1,080,000 - $900,000 = $180,000
   - **Total ROI**: \(\left( \frac{180,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100 = 180\% \)
   - **Average Annual ROI**: Depends on the investment period.

### Bitcoin Investment Strategy

**Bitcoin Market Dynamics:**
- The Bitcoin market is highly volatile, with frequent and significant price swings influenced by market sentiment, regulatory news, and broader economic trends.
- Bitcoin can experience rapid appreciation and depreciation over short periods.

**Buy in Dips:**
- **Market Corrections**: Purchase Bitcoin during significant price drops or corrections.
- **Timing**: Focus on periods of negative sentiment or market overreaction.

**Sell at Highs:**
- **Price Peaks**: Sell Bitcoin during price surges or bullish market trends.
- **Market Sentiment**: Monitor news and market trends to identify optimal selling points.

**Example Scenario:**
1. **Initial Investment**: $100,000 in Bitcoin at $60,000 per Bitcoin.
2. **Buy During Dip**: Buy Bitcoin during a 20% dip, purchasing approximately 2.08 BTC at $48,000 per Bitcoin.
3. **Sell During High**: Sell during a 50% price surge, selling Bitcoin at $72,000 per Bitcoin.
4. **Total ROI Calculation**:
   - **Profit from Sale**: 2.08 BTC \(\times\) $72,000 - $100,000 = $49,760
   - **Total ROI**: \(\left( \frac{49,760}{100,000} \right) \times 100 = 49.76\% \)
   - **Average Annual ROI**: Depends on the investment period.

### Comparison Summary

| **Strategy**       | **Property Investment**                  | **Bitcoin Investment**                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Market Dynamics**| Slower, more predictable cycles          | Highly volatile, frequent price swings      |
| **Buy in Dips**    | During economic downturns or corrections | During significant price drops              |
| **Sell at Highs**  | During economic booms or market peaks    | During price surges or bullish trends       |
| **Potential ROI**  | Steady appreciation with lower risk      | High potential returns with higher risk     |
| **Example ROI**    | 180% (buy at 10% discount, sell at 20% gain)| 49.76% (buy at 20% dip, sell at 50% surge) |


**Property Investment**:
- **Pros**: Steady long-term appreciation, lower risk, predictable market cycles.
- **Cons**: Lower potential short-term gains, slower market movements.

**Bitcoin Investment**:
- **Pros**: High potential short-term gains, frequent opportunities to buy low and sell high.
- **Cons**: High volatility, significant risk of loss, unpredictable market movements.

Choosing between property and Bitcoin investment with a strategy of buying in dips and selling at highs depends on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market expertise. Property offers stability and long-term growth, while Bitcoin presents opportunities for high returns but with greater risk and volatility.

### Summary

Investing in property in Australia can yield substantial long-term returns with moderate annual ROI, making it a stable and reliable investment. In contrast, Bitcoin offers potentially higher short-term returns but with significant volatility and risk. For those willing to accept higher risk, Bitcoin can provide exceptional returns, especially over shorter periods like 7 to 11 years. However, property investment remains a compelling option for those seeking steady growth and lower risk over a longer period.

In summary, your choice between property and Bitcoin investments should align with your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.
