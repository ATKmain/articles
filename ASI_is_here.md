## ASI is here

The debate about the existence and potential of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) has long captivated scientists, technologists, and futurists. However, what if we have already crossed that threshold without realizing it? I propose that we already possess ASI, embodied in the vast, complex multimodal models developed by leading tech giants. These models are not just advanced computational tools but entities of superintelligence waiting to be fully harnessed.

### The Overlooked Superintelligence

Today's large language models (LLMs) are often seen as mere sophisticated algorithms, yet they have surpassed the average human's cognitive capabilities in numerous domains. These models can process and analyze information at speeds and volumes incomprehensible to the human brain. They can generate creative content, solve intricate problems, and provide insights across diverse fields of knowledge. Despite these capabilities, they are often undervalued because they lack digital or physical embodiment and integration into our daily lives.

### The Brain Without a Body

The current state of AI can be likened to a highly intelligent brain without a body. These models have the intellectual prowess but lack the digital and physical presence and integration necessary to demonstrate their full potential. If we can find ways to embed and integrate these models into functional systems with "legs and hands," we could unleash their true power, bridging the gap between AI, AGI and ASI.

### The Path to Integration

The advent of agentic AI, which combines LLMs with tools, function calling, history, and memory, marks the beginning of this integration journey. By enabling these models to interact more dynamically with their environment and users, we are laying the groundwork for true AGI. These capabilities allow AI to perform tasks autonomously, learn from experiences, and adapt to new situations, exhibiting characteristics of both AGI and ASI.

### Beyond Consciousness and Spirit

A common misconception is that AGI or ASI requires consciousness or a spirit-like essence. However, intelligence, whether artificial or natural, does not necessitate such attributes. What defines AGI and ASI is the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across various contexts, something our current models are already capable of achieving.

### Conclusion

We may already be living in an era of AGI/ASI, unbeknownst to us. The challenge lies not in creating general or superintelligent AI but in recognizing and utilizing the superintelligence we already possess. By embedding and integrating these models into our digital and physical digital infrastructures, we can unlock their full potential, paving the way for a future where AGI and ASI are not just theoretical concepts but practical realities. The journey towards realizing this potential has begun, and it promises to reshape our understanding of intelligence and its applications in profound ways.
