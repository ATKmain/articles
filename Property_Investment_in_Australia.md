### Why Investing in Property in Australia Can Yield High ROI

Investing in property has long been considered a solid and lucrative strategy for growing wealth, particularly in markets like Australia. Property investments can deliver high returns on investment (ROI) due to consistent property appreciation, rental income, and the leveraging effect of loans. In this article, we will explore why property investment can yield such high returns, using average numbers to provide a comprehensive overview of potential outcomes over 10, 20, and 30 years. We will base our example on an initial investment of $100,000, leveraging a loan to buy property, and accounting for common costs such as management fees and selling commissions.

#### Average Numbers in Australia

1. **Property Appreciation**: Historically, Australian property prices have appreciated at an average annual rate of 6-7%.
2. **Rental Yield**: Rental yields in Australia typically range from 3-5%, with an average around 4%.
3. **Loan Interest Rates**: The average home loan interest rate hovers around 3-4%.
4. **Management Fees**: Property management fees are usually around 10% of rental income.
5. **Selling Commissions**: Real estate agent commission fees are approximately 2.5% of the selling price.

### Investment Example: Initial $100,000

Assume you invest $100,000 as a down payment on a $1,000,000 property (90% loan), and sell the property at the end of each period (10, 20, and 30 years).

#### Key Assumptions
- **Property Value**: $1,000,000
- **Down Payment (Equity)**: $100,000
- **Loan Amount**: $900,000 (90% LTV)
- **Interest Rate**: 4%
- **Property Appreciation**: 7% per annum
- **Rental Yield**: 4% per annum
- **Management Fees**: 10% of rental income
- **Selling Commission**: 2.5% of property value

### Calculations Over Different Periods

#### 10 Years

**Future Property Value**:
\[ \text{Future Value} = 1,000,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{10} = 1,967,151 \]

**Remaining Loan Balance (after 10 years)**:
Using an amortization calculator:
\[ \text{Remaining Balance} \approx 731,000 \]

**Total Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Rental Income} = 1,000,000 \times 0.04 = 40,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Rental Income over 10 years} = 40,000 \times 10 = 400,000 \]

**Net Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Management Fee} = 40,000 \times 0.10 = 4,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Rental Income} = 40,000 - 4,000 = 36,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Net Rental Income over 10 years} = 36,000 \times 10 = 360,000 \]

**Total Mortgage Payments**:
\[ \text{Annual Mortgage Payment} = 12 \times 4,297.45 = 51,569.40 \]
\[ \text{Total Mortgage Payments over 10 years} = 51,569.40 \times 10 = 515,694 \]

**Total Interest Paid**:
Using an amortization calculator, the total interest paid over 10 years is approximately $314,217.

**Net Cash Flow**:
\[ \text{Net Cash Flow} = 360,000 - 314,217 = 45,783 \]

**Profit from Sale**:
\[ \text{Selling Commission} = 1,967,151 \times 0.025 = 49,179 \]
\[ \text{Net Selling Price} = 1,967,151 - 49,179 = 1,917,972 \]
\[ \text{Profit from Sale} = 1,917,972 - 731,000 = 1,186,972 \]

**Total Profit**:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 1,186,972 + 45,783 = 1,232,755 \]

#### 20 Years

**Future Property Value**:
\[ \text{Future Value} = 1,000,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{20} = 3,869,684 \]

**Remaining Loan Balance (after 20 years)**:
Using an amortization calculator:
\[ \text{Remaining Balance} \approx 466,000 \]

**Total Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Rental Income} = 1,000,000 \times 0.04 = 40,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Rental Income over 20 years} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \]

**Net Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Management Fee} = 40,000 \times 0.10 = 4,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Rental Income} = 40,000 - 4,000 = 36,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Net Rental Income over 20 years} = 36,000 \times 20 = 720,000 \]

**Total Mortgage Payments**:
\[ \text{Annual Mortgage Payment} = 12 \times 4,297.45 = 51,569.40 \]
\[ \text{Total Mortgage Payments over 20 years} = 51,569.40 \times 20 = 1,031,388 \]

**Total Interest Paid**:
Using an amortization calculator, the total interest paid over 20 years is approximately $548,564.

**Net Cash Flow**:
\[ \text{Net Cash Flow} = 720,000 - 548,564 = 171,436 \]

**Profit from Sale**:
\[ \text{Selling Commission} = 3,869,684 \times 0.025 = 96,742 \]
\[ \text{Net Selling Price} = 3,869,684 - 96,742 = 3,772,942 \]
\[ \text{Profit from Sale} = 3,772,942 - 466,000 = 3,306,942 \]

**Total Profit**:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 3,306,942 + 171,436 = 3,478,378 \]

#### 30 Years

\[ \text{Future Value} = 1,000,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{30} = 7,612,255 \]

**Remaining Loan Balance (after 30 years)**:
Using an amortization calculator:
\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = 0 \] (Loan fully paid off)

**Total Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Rental Income} = 1,000,000 \times 0.04 = 40,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Rental Income over 30 years} = 40,000 \times 30 = 1,200,000 \]

**Net Rental Income**:
\[ \text{Annual Management Fee} = 40,000 \times 0.10 = 4,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Rental Income} = 40,000 - 4,000 = 36,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Net Rental Income over 30 years} = 36,000 \times 30 = 1,080,000 \]

**Total Mortgage Payments**:
\[ \text{Annual Mortgage Payment} = 12 \times 4,297.45 = 51,569.40 \]
\[ \text{Total Mortgage Payments over 30 years} = 51,569.40 \times 30 = 1,547,082 \]

**Total Interest Paid**:
Using an amortization calculator, the total interest paid over 30 years is approximately $810,973.

**Net Cash Flow**:
\[ \text{Net Cash Flow} = 1,080,000 - 810,973 = 269,027 \]

**Profit from Sale**:
\[ \text{Selling Commission} = 7,612,255 \times 0.025 = 190,306 \]
\[ \text{Net Selling Price} = 7,612,255 - 190,306 = 7,421,949 \]
\[ \text{Profit from Sale} = 7,421,949 \]

**Total Profit**:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 7,421,949 + 269,027 = 7,690,976 \]

## Why ROI reduce
The Average Annual ROI decreases when the length of the investment increases due to the nature of compound growth and the amortization of loans. Here's a detailed explanation of why this happens:

### Compound Growth and Diminishing Returns

1. **Initial High Returns**: In the early years of property investment, the returns can appear very high because the initial investment (down payment) is relatively small compared to the leveraged amount (total property value). The property value increases based on the total value, not just the down payment, leading to high initial ROI.

2. **Compounding Effect**: Over time, while the absolute returns grow due to the compounding effect of appreciation, the relative percentage growth (annual ROI) tends to stabilize or decrease. This is because the base value (initial investment) grows larger, and additional gains represent a smaller percentage of this larger base.

### Loan Amortization

1. **Interest Payments**: In the initial years of a mortgage, a significant portion of the monthly payments goes towards paying interest rather than principal. This means that the net gains (after interest payments) are lower in the beginning, but as time goes on, more of the payment goes towards the principal, reducing the interest burden.

2. **Decreasing Interest Payments**: Over a longer period, the interest component decreases, and the principal repayment increases. However, the total return calculation includes all payments made, which can lower the annualized ROI as the investment period extends.

### Cost Impact

1. **Management Fees and Selling Commissions**: These costs impact the overall profit but are relatively fixed percentages. As the investment duration increases, the impact of these costs is spread over a longer period, slightly stabilizing the ROI but also contributing to a lower annualized return when calculated over an extended time frame.

### Conclusion

Investing in property in Australia can yield high returns due to consistent property appreciation, rental income, and the leveraging effect of loans. While the absolute returns grow over time, the average annual ROI tends
